📌 Task-03: Text Generation using Markov Chains

This project is part of my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech under the GA (Generative AI) track.
The goal of this task was to understand how text generation works at a basic level using probability-based models like Markov Chains.

Instead of relying on complex deep learning models, this task focuses on learning the core idea behind how machines can generate new text from existing data.

🧠 What I Worked On

Used a simple text corpus as input

Processed the text into words

Built a Markov Chain to understand word-to-word transitions

Generated new text based on probability

Even with simple logic, the model was able to generate meaningful and readable sentences.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🎯 What I Learned

How Markov Chains can be used for text generation

The role of probability in Natural Language Processing

How text generation works without deep learning models

Strengthened my fundamentals in Generative AI

🏁 Final Thoughts

This task was simple yet very informative. It helped me understand the foundation of text generation techniques and how powerful basic models can be.
It was a great learning experience during my internship, and I’m excited to continue exploring more Generative AI concepts 🚀
